## What You Need to Provide
For each provider, I'll need:

- Client ID (Application ID)
- Client Secret
Once you have these credentials, I can update them in your Django application just like we did with Google!

## Important Notes
- Make sure to use the exact redirect URIs provided above
- For production, replace 127.0.0.1:8000 with your actual domain
- Keep your client secrets secure and never commit them to version control
